Bubble Sort (switches in the inner loop based on comparison of immediate adjacent element using a temp variable) - O(n**2) algorithm - very slow
Merge Sort (divide the list into several equal halfs, bubble sort and then merge) - O(n log n) algorithm
Insertion Sort (starts from first index. Each index compares with data in all previous indexes and switches) - O(n**2)
