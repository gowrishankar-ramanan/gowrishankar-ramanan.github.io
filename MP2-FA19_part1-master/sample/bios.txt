Education Ph.D. Electrial Engineering, Stanford University, 2001 . Research Interests data mining, database systems, machine learning, information retrieval, web search/mining, social media analytics Research Statement I lead the FORWARD Group , which is part of the larger Data and Information Systems Laboratories , at the CS department of UIUC.Our research overall aims at bridging structured and unstructured big data --- to bring structured/semantic-rich access to the myriad and massive unstructured data which accounts for most of the world's information. Therefore, our research spans across data mining, data management/databases , information retrieval, machine learning , with current efforts focusing oninteractive data management,entity-centric Web search and mining,social media analytics,andsocial network mining.As our objectives, we aim at developing novel systems, principled algorithms, and formal theories that ultimately deliver real world applications. As our approaches, we seek to be inspired by and learn from the data we are tackling-- i.e., we believe the key to tame big data is to learn the wisdom hidden in the large scale of the data. Undergraduate Research Opportunities Our FORWARD Lab welcome undergraduate students to participate in research with us. You will join our projects to work with graduate students for design algorithms and implement systems in data management, data mining, and social media/network analytics. Graduate Research Opportunities I am looking for PhD/MS students to join the research project at the FORWARD Lab . Our current projects studies theories and algorithms as well as build systems for real world data management applications for Web search/mining and social media analytics.

 Alex Kirlik Professor 4220 Siebel Center for Comp Sci 201 N. Goodwin Ave. Urbana Illinois 61801 (217) 244-8972 kirlik@illinois.edu : Primary Research Area Interactive Computing - Human-Computer Interaction Research Areas Human-Computer Interaction Visualization Biography Alex Kirlik is Professor in the Department of Computer Science with additional appointments in the Department of Industrial & Enterprise Systems Engineering, the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, and the Information Trust Institute, the Coordinated Science Laboratory, the Intelligent Robotics Laboratory and the Illinois Informatics Institute. He previously served as acting head of Illinois's Human Factors program in the Institute of Aviation from 2006-2010. Alex earned his B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Industrial & Systems Engineering (Human-Machine Systems) at The Ohio State University. His Ph.D. thesis, "The organization of perception and action in complex control skills" earned the George Briggs Award from APA's Division of Applied Experimental and Engineering Psychologists, as the best dissertation of the year. During his academic career, in addition to positions held with his home institutions at the University of Illinois (2002-date) and Georgia Tech (1989-2001), Alex has held visiting positions at Stanford University and NASA Ames Research Center (ASEE-NASA Stanford Summer Faculty Fellow, 1989, 1990), Yale University, Haskins Laboratory and the University of Connecticut (Visiting Scholar, 2001-02 academic year), Draper Laboratory, Cambridge, MA (Sabbatical Research, 2012-13 academic year), and the Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety (Visiting Scholar, summer 2015). Alex's research interests include human-computer interaction, human factors, visual analytics to support judgment and decision making, human-robot interaction, social computing, human-automation interaction and decision support is sociotechnical systems such as aviation, space, intelligence analysis, severe weather forecasting, disaster and emergency response, healthcare and medicine, autonomous vehicles, education and so forth. Alex's approach to teaching and mentoring students is naturally dependent of the level of instruction involved. Perhaps one notable aspect of his educational approach is that no crisp line can be drawn between his interests and activities in research and teaching. For example, he has advised 2 PhD dissertations on the development and evaluation of new techniques and technologies for teaching engineering design.His research and educational activities also dovetail in the realm of his graduate seminars, which are intensively group- and project-based, typically involving students in actual research projects to motivate and animate the course material. For example, in 2010 Alex seized on an opportunity afforded by a U.S. Challenge.gov Health and Human Services competition that required competing project teams to design a Facebook app that would be useful to people in the aftermath of natural disasters and emergencies. This project not only involved the students, working as a design team, to create a conceptual design for the app, but to also create a working software prototype and a video demo. The competition was open to any group who wanted to enter it was not specifically targeted to the educational community or to educational institutions. The students design earned 3rd place nationally. Education Ph.D. Industrial & Systems Engineering, The Ohio State University, 1989. . Research Statement Alex Kirliks research program in human-computer interaction, human factors, and cognitive science & engineering has focused on understanding and supporting the cognition (judgment, decision making, prediction, problem solving and system control), of professionals working in technological workplaces, operational contexts and sociotechnical systems. His research contributing to commercial aviation safety in both airborne and ground operations has been supported by NASA for over 25 years. Recently, aspects of these lines of research have matured into NSF- and NASA-sponsored multidisciplinary projects, joint with collaborators in aerospace, mechanical and software engineering, to create and evaluate formal techniques and general principles for the design of safe and robust cyber-physical-human systems comprised of people and hardware and software automation: Engineering Safety-Critical Cyber-Physical-Human (CPH) Systems. The aim of this research, which is relevant to applications not solely in aviation but in contexts such as healthcare and highways, is to achieve levels of human-automation system performance, robustness and safety exceeding what would be achievable by either a human or automation acting alone. A 5-minute public video demo illustrating this work in an aviation context is available at: www.youtube.com/watch . A second major thrust of Alex's research concerns support for judgment and decision making in high-stakes tasks. This line of research developed into an NSF-sponsored project to develop and evaluate quantitative models of judgment in technological systems (e.g., KIrlik, 2006, Adaptive Perspectives on Human-Technology Interaction , NY: Oxford; see: www.oup.com/us/companion.websites/9780195171822/ ). Recently, Alex also participated in an IARPA-sponsored project to develop visual analytics to support intelligence analysts in forecasting world events: http://www.draper.com/news/draper-team-aims-improve-predictions-through-sp-de/?cc=us&lang=en&" , and most recently, he and his multi-disciplinary team began a 3-year research project involving the design and use of domestic, aerial and ground robotics to support aging-in-place called ASPIRE: Automation Supporting Prolonged Independent Residence for the Elderly, sponsored by the National Robotics Initiative. A brief video showing progress to date, presented at the October, 2016 "Aging 2.0" conference in San Francisco can be viewed at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoUvRaTnA8c#action=share" Also, Alex has co-edited (with J.D. Lee) the first authoritative handbook of its kind, The Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Engineering (2013), representing the contributions of more than 60 of the disciplines most influential and accomplished researchers. He has been editor of the Oxford Series in Human-Technology Interaction for Oxford University Press for more than 10 years, a series that includes more than a dozen scholarly books and edited volumes by prominent researchers published to date: https://global.oup.com/academic/content/series/h/human-technology-interaction-series-hti/?cc=us&lang=en& Undergraduate Research Opportunities Alex often has paid or for-credit undergraduate research opportunities in both human-computer interaction and human factors.

I am interested in exploring the computability of equilibria, both market and Nash, under various settings, and also understanding the impact of strategic behavior in multi-agent situations. Currently, I am exploring problems from dynamic matching, fair division of scarce resources, and market design for cloud computing. In addition I am exploring avenues for interdisciplinary applications of these tools to genetic evolution, machine learning and dynamical systems.

Research Interests Computational Historical Linguistics Metagenomics Multiple sequence alignment Phylogenomics Phylogenetic tree estimation Big Data Discrete and graph-theoretic algorithms Research Statement My research combines mathematics, computer science, probability, and statistics, in order to develop algorithms with improved accuracy for large-scale and complex estimation problems in phylogenomics and metagenomics. My major interests include multiple sequence alignment and phylogeny estimation (both gene trees and species trees) and metagenomic analysis, but I also work in Historical Linguistics. My current work aims to develop methods for ultra-large datasets (anywhere from 10,000 to 1,000,000 sequences), including datasets that are highly fragmentary and present other real world challenges. We use real data and perform massive simulations to evaluate the performance of methods that we develop, and also collaborate closely with biologists and linguists in data analysis. Graduate Research Opportunities My research is currently focused on four topics, and all have multiple open questions where graduate students (MS or PhD) would be helpful. Although the topics are described in terms of biological or linguistic data, the research is to develop novel computational methods that provide excellent accuracy and scalability. All these problems have deep mathematical foundations, and almost all involve NP-hard statistical estimation problems. There are opportunities to prove theorems (if you are mathematically inclined), develop and implement heuristics for NP-hard problems, develop parallel implementations of methods, and analyze datasets. Graduate students should be strong programmers, and mathematical intuition is very helpful as well. No background is needed in biology or linguistics!! 1. Phylogenomics - estimation of species trees and/or phylogenetic networks from multiple loci. The main focus is on combining gene trees that exhibit conflict due to incomplete lineage sorting or horizontal gene transfer (or even duplication and loss). 2. Metagenomics - taxonomic characterization of very short sequences sampled from environmental samples. 3. Multiple sequence alignment - especially for very large datasets (up to one million sequences) that are highly fragmentary 4. Historical linguistics - and analysis of Indo-European and other language families.
