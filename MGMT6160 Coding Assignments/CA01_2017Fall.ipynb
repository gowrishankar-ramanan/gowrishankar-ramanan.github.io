    "The p-norm of a vector v = ($v_1,v_2,...,v_n$) in n-dimensional space is defined as $||v|| = \\sqrt[p]{v_1^p + v_2^p + \\ldots + v_n^p}$. For the special case of p = 2, this results in the traditional Euclidean norm, which represents the length of the vector. For example, the Euclidean norm of a two-dimensional vector with coordinates (4,3) has a Euclidean norm of $\\sqrt{4^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{25} = 5$. Give an implementation of a function named norm such that norm(v, p) returns the p-norm value of v and norm(v) returns the Euclidean norm of v. You may assume that v is a list of numbers and p>0."
